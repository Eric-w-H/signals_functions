# signals_functions
Ongoing repo to sort of mimic the functionality Matlab signals toolkit.

All the functions are defined in the first cell of the notebook. If someone wants to pull these into a module, be my guest -- open a pull request. I will try to keep this updated after lecture with new, useful functions as Delchamps teaches them.
